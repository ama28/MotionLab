Now, we will introduce you to the lab equipment. On the table, you can see the micropipette that you will be using. Different micropipettes take up different ranges of volumes. This one is a P-200 micropipette which measures volumes between 20-200 µl. On the body of the micropipette is a small vertical window with three numbers. These numbers, read from the top down, tell you how much volume the micropipette will take up. Right now, the P-200 micropipette is set to 20 µl.
