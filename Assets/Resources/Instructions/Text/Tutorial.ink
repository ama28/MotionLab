First, we will learn about how to navigate MotionLab. MotionLab uses the LeapMotion, a sensor which recognizes your hand motions and translates them into the virtual environment. Your hands will be represented in the virtual lab by a white outline.  Place your hands about two inches above the sensor, with your palms facing down. Make sure that your virtual hands are correctly aligned to your real hands before continuing. 

To see the menu, open your left hand and rotate it so your palm is facing upwards. ðŸŽ‰ [Fill in what menu does later - Viewing Modes, Home, Reset, Instructional Modes).You can interact with items in the lab by grabbing them. Try grabbing the highlighted pipette with your hand and moving it around. ðŸŽ‰

Lastly, you can keep track of where you are in the experiment through the progress bar on the top of the screen.
