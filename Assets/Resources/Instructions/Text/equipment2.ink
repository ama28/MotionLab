Also on the table is a small tip box. The small tips are for the P-20 and P-200 micropipettes, and the large tips, which aren't currently shown, are for the P-1000. Before you pipette liquid, you should place a fresh tip on the micropipette. Make sure that the only thing the tip touches is the liquid. After you finish pipetting, you should discard the tip in the waste bin. This helps ensure that you do not contaminate the liquid you are pipetting. In this experiment, the tip is already attached.
